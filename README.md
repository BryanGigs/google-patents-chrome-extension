# google-patents-chrome-extension
This chrome extension produces an easy to copy and paste list of patent numbers displayed in a Google Patents results page.

Any time you go to a Google Patents page, including either types:
	"patents.google.com/" OR "www.google.com/tbm=pts",
a blue "P#" icon will appear in the browser address bar in Chrome, which when clicked will show a list of the 10 patent numbers in the results page, if you are on a results page.

This tool is just a minimally funcitonal beta version and has room for improvement, so please let me know if it isn't working when it should, by sending an email to bryan.j.giglio@gmail.com with the url of the page it didn't work on, but should have.  Thanks and enjoy!
